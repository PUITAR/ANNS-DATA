# A Dataframe Based on Ann-Benchmark

We develop the download framework slightly based on ann-benchmark, which is a benchmark for ANN algorithms and is the most complete and comprehensive benchmark for ANN algorithms so far. For more details, please refer to the [Ann-Benchmark](https://github.com/ann-benchmark/ann-benchmark) repository.

We only use the downloader of the ann-benchmark. And you can use the script `create_dataset.py` to download and convert your interest datasets into **vecs**-format.

To use the script, you can use the command: `python create_dataset.py -h`.
